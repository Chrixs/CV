##### About me

I am a Makers Academy Full Stack Junior Developer with experience in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, Unity, HTML5 and CSS.

I am enthusiastic about development and the opportunities development has to offer. I started as just an enthusiastic amateur with no experience with code, over the course of just 12 week at Makers I've progressed dramatically into a confident junior developer. I'm dedicated to writing SOLID, clean and test driven code.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving
As a child and still to this day I love to disassemble and reassemble things to see how they work, I'm always curious to see how something is made and what came together to achieve it.

#### Team Player
During my time studying music at university I was a part of many bands and groups. Being in a band taught me many things but the biggest thing I took from it was how to be a functioning and integral part of a project bigger than just me. I developed greater personal discipline in practice and work since I now had people that relied on me to do my part and pull my weight just as I relied on them.

#### Perseverance
Learning to play musical instruments has taught how to deal with frustration and to not give up when the going gets tough, often I would spend hours on a part that was only a few seconds long, repeating it over and over until I got it perfect. During my time at Makers Academy I used this skill to keep myself motivated and engaged especially when looking for elusive bugs or trying to implement a difficult feature.

#### Fast Learner
In the last two weeks of Makers I was using Unity and writing scripts in C# having never used or seen either before.

#### Adaptability
At Makers Academy we were constantly exposed to new technologies each week, I loved each new project we set out to do as it meant diving in to something I had little to no knowledge about.
